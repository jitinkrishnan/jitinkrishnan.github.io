**About Me**\
I am a Research Scientist at Meta AI, working in a team that builds cutting-edge Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing models for modern Recommender Systems. Before joining Meta, I received my PhD in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2021. During my PhD, I did research internships at Meta, Amazon Alexa, and NASA Goddard. I was also a faculty at GMU and at the Governor's School, teaching Intro to Programming, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures. Prior to this, I obtained my BS in Computer Science (and a minor in Economics) from the University of Virginia in 2013. My research interests include Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Multimodal and Multilingual Understanding, Graph Learning, and Explainable AI. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, playing badminton/soccer/chess, and some occasional [photography](https://www.instagram.com/jikri_photography/).
