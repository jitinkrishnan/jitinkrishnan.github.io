I am a Research Scientist at Meta AI, building cutting-edge Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing models for modern Recommender Systems. Before joining Meta, I received my PhD in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2021. Prior to that, I have done research internships at Meta, Amazon Alexa, and NASA GSFC. I obtained my BS in Computer Science (and a minor in Economics) from University of Virginia in 2013. My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Graph Learning, Multimodal and Multilingual models, and Explainable AI. Feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn.
