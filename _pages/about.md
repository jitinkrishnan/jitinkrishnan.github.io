I am a Research Scientist at Meta AI, building cutting-edge Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing models for modern Recommender Systems. Before joining Meta, I received my PhD in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2021. Prior to that, I did research internships at Meta, Amazon Alexa, and NASA GSFC. I was also a faculty at George Mason University and the Governor's School, teaching Intro to Programming, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures. I obtained my BS in Computer Science (and a minor in Economics) from University of Virginia in 2013. My research interests include Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Graph Learning, Multimodal and Multilingual models, and Explainable AI. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, playing badminton, soccer, and chess, and some occasional photography.
